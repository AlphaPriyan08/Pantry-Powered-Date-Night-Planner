#🕯️ Pantry-Powered Date-Night Planner
An interactive AI agent that transforms your available pantry ingredients into a complete, personalized, and romantic date-night plan.
This project demonstrates the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and conversational AI frameworks to create a helpful and engaging user experience. The agent doesn't just give you a recipe; it acts as a "romance concierge," helping you plan the meal, the ambiance, and even a conversation starter, refining its suggestions based on your feedback.

#✨ Features
Conversational Planning: Tell the agent what ingredients you have, and it will start the planning process.
Holistic Experience: Get suggestions for a main dish, ambiance (music & lighting), decor, and an icebreaker.
Iterative Refinement: The agent asks for your feedback and adjusts the plan until you say it's perfect. Don't like a suggestion? Just say so!
Interactive UI: A simple and clean chat interface with suggested reply buttons to guide the conversation.
Memory: The agent remembers the context of your conversation to provide relevant and personalized refinements.

#🛠️ Tech Stack
This project is built with a modern, Python-based AI stack:
LLM Framework: LangChain - Used to orchestrate the agent's logic, manage memory, and chain prompts.
LLM: Google Gemini - The generative model that powers the agent's creativity and reasoning, accessed via the langchain-google-genai library.
Web Framework: Streamlit - Used to rapidly build the interactive chat-based user interface.
Environment Management: python-dotenv - For securely managing the API key.
